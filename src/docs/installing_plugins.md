# Installing Plugins

After you downloaded (or made your plugin) you will need to install it to use it. The way you do it is simple!

-   Copy the plugin DLL into `%appdata%\Project Black Pearl\Extensions`
-   It should come with Images and Scrapers, put the images on the `Images` folder
-   And put the scrapers on the `Scrapers` folder

After that, your plugin should be installed! Now you can boot up PBP and use it.
