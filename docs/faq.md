## Why aren't games appearing when I search for them?

There are several reasons why this may be happening, included but not limited to:

-   The response of the plugin you're using doesn't match the required response schema.
-   The plugin you're using took too long to fetch results for your search
-   The plugin you're using couldn't find the game you searched for.

## When I try to run a game it doesn't work

The game/app you are running might need Admin privileges, so try to run PBP as admin and try to launch the game/app again
