<h1 class="title">Installing Plugins</h1>

After you downloaded (or made your plugin) you will need to install it to use it. There's 2 ways of doing it; both are easy!

## Via PBP

-   Open the app and go to Preferences
-   Click the install plugin button
-   Select your plugin and click OK

## Manually

-   Move your plugin to:
    -   On Windows: `%appdata%\org.blackpearl.PBP\scrapers\`
    -   On macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.blackpearl.PBP/scrapers/`
    -   On Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/org.blackpearl.PBP/scrapers/`
-   Restart PBP

Currently also you can only uninstall plugins via the manual way
