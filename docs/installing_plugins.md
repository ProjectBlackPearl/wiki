## Via PBP

-   Open the app and go to **'Preferences'**.
-   Click the button labeled **'Install a plugin'**.
-   Select the executable for the plugin you'd like to install and click **'Open'**.
-   Restart PBP.

## Manually

-   Move the executable for the plugin you'd like to install to one of the following directories **(depending on your host operating system)**:
    -   **Windows:** `%appdata%\org.blackpearl.PBP\scrapers\`
    -   **MacOS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.blackpearl.PBP/scrapers/`
    -   **Linux:** `$HOME/.local/share/org.blackpearl.PBP/scrapers/`
-   Restart PBP.
